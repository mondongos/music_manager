# Music Manager

A place for me to store links to music I find across the web, including YouTube, Spotify and Soundcloud. They are embedded them so they're easily playable. I can sort links by date and name.

The site will have all the following specifications:

- Show a list of bookmarks
- Add new bookmarks
- Delete bookmarks
- Update bookmarks
- Comment on bookmarks
- Tag bookmarks into categories
- Filter bookmarks by tag
- Users are restricted to manage only their own bookmarks
